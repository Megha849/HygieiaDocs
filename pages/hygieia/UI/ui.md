The UI Layer represents Hygieia's front-end and contains GUI elements for users to view and configure the DevOps tools on the dashboard.

The Hygieia dashboard requires installation of:

- NodeJS
- npm
- gulp
- bower

#### Mac OS X Installation

If you do not already have NodeJS installed, download and install the NodeJS MSI package available at: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

*	**Step 1: Install Homebrew**

	Homebrew handles downloading, unpacking and installing npm on your system.
	To install Homebrew, open terminal and execute the following command:

	```bash
	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	```
	
 	Follow the messages in the terminal to complete the installation process.

*	**Step 2: Install npm**

	To install npm using Homebrew, execute the following command:
	
	```bash
	brew install node
	```

*	**Step 3: Install Global Packages**

	Execute the following commands to install packages to the global `node_modules` directory:
	
	```bash
	npm install -g bower
	npm install -g gulp
	```
	Install dependencies configured with bower and npm:

	```bash
	# Install dependencies listed in package.json
	npm install
	# Install dependencies listed in bower.json
	bower install
	```

*	**Step 4: Run the UI**
	
	In the terminal, navigate to the `/Hygieia/UI` and execute the following command:
	
	```bash
	gulp serve
	```
	
	The dashboard will serve up on port 3000.
	
#### Windows Installation

If you do not already have NodeJS installed, download and install the NodeJS MSI package available at: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

*	**Step 1: Install npm**

	Execute the following commands using command line to install bower and gulp globally:

	```bash
	npm install -g bower
	npm install -g gulp
	```
	
	From your project's root directory, use Git Shell to install bower using the following command:

	```bash
	# Install dependencies listed in bower.json
	npm install
	# Install dependencies listed in bower.json
	bower install
	```

*	**Step 2: Run the UI**

	To run the dashboard, in the command prompt, navigate to `\Hygieia\UI`, and then execute the following command:

	```bash
	gulp serve
	```
	The dashboard will serve up on port 3000.

	To execute using browser-sync's [`ghostMode`](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/options#option-ghostMode) functionality:

	```bash
	gulp serve:ghost-mode
	```

	To run using Maven, navigate to `\Hygieia\UI`, and then execute the following command:

	```bash
	mvn clean package integration-test
	```

**Note**: To test Hygieia's UI layer locally using mock test data, execute the following command:

```bash
gulp serve --local true
```
API is not required since data currently comes from the test-data directory.

### Docker Image for UI Layer

To configure the Hygieia UI layer, execute the following steps:

*	**Step 1: Run Maven Build**

	To package the API source code into an executable JAR file, run the maven build from the `\Hygieia` directory of your source code installation:

	```bash
	mvn clean package -pl UI docker:build
	```
	
*	**Step 2: Run the UI**

	To run the UI from Docker, execute the following command from the command prompt:
	
	```bash
	docker run -t -p 8088:80 --link hygieia-api -i hygieia-ui:latest
	```
	
### Dashboard Layouts

Select a layout for your dashboard. Layouts for the dashboard are available at `src\components\templates`. You can choose a custom template or customize your dashboard layout by selecting widgets while creating your dashboard. The available custom templates are:

* Cap One
* Cap One ChatOps
* Cloud Dashboard
* Split View

### API Check

Once the UI is successfully connected, the following screenshots show the API connection status:

### Encryption for Private Repos

1. From the core module, generate a secret key.

```bash
java -jar <path-to-jar>/core-2.0.5-SNAPSHOT.jar com.capitalone.dashboard.util.Encryption
```

2. Add the generated key to the API properties file.

```bash
#dashboard.properties
key=<your-generated-key>
```

3. Add the same key to your repo settings file. This is required for the target collector to decrypt your saved repo password.

For example, if your repo is GitHub, add the following to the `github.properties` file:

```bash
#github.properties
github.key=<your-generated-key>
```
